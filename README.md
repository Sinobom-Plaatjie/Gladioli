*Our problem statement is* ...
Most victims of Gender-based violence, would rather suffer in silence, than open up about their traumatic experiences. 
This affects the issue of collection & storing crucial evidence on time.

 *Solution* 
We built a mobile app that is helping GBV victims create digital personal diaries and store evidence virtually. 
We also added Find Me feature that will help victim to send their locations to their loved ones when they are in danger.
